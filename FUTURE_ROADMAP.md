# Future Roadmap: Beyond v2.0

Based on the needs of professional competition hosts, here are 4 strategic features that would significantly elevate the platform's value.

## 1. 🗳️ Audience Choice (Crowd Voting)
**The "Engagement" Engine**
Currently, only Judges determine the winner. High-energy events effectively need audience participation.
-   **Feature**: Allow the public to vote for their favorite team via their mobile phones (QR Code).
-   **Host Benefit**: massive engagement boost; "People's Choice" awards.
-   **Integration**: These votes can be a weighted part of the total score (e.g., 10%) or a separate leaderboard.

## 2. 📤 Participant Submission Portal
**The "Input" Engine**
Currently, Judges score participants based on what they see. There is no place for participants to submit work.
-   **Feature**: A private dashboard where teams upload PDFs, GitHub links, or Slides.
-   **Host Benefit**: Judges can view the "Submission" on their iPad/Laptop *while* grading.
-   **Access**: Participants claim their profile via a "Magic Link" sent to email.

## 3. 🎓 Smart Certificates & Report Cards
**The "Takeaway" Engine**
Currently, the event ends and data sits in the DB.
-   **Feature**: Auto-generate PDF "Report Cards" showing breakdown of scores handling feedback anonymity.
-   **Host Benefit**: Incredible value-add for participants (they get tangible feedback). Can also auto-issue "Winner" certificates.

## 4. 📺 Kiosk Mode (Lobby Display)
**The "Signage" Engine**
Events need automated signage in hallways.
-   **Feature**: A "cycle" view that rotates between "Up Next", "Current Standings", and "Sponsor Logos".
-   **Host Benefit**: Professional digital signage without needing extra software.
